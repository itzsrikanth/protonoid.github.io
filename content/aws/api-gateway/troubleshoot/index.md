# Troubleshooting AWS API Gateway

### No integration defined for method (Service: AmazonApiGateway; Status Code: 400; Error Code: BadRequestException; Request ID: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-9e38-1f29af926f7f)
Here, if we have methods for resources without any integration specified, we need to comment them temporarily atleast if we want to proceed with deployment.
