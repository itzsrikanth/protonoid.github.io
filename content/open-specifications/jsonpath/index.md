# JSONPath

## Introduction
JSONPath is an equivalent of XPath, which basically is query-based language for querying nested or subsections in them. Here, we are limiting our context to Velocity Template Language. To access a key's value in JSON document within a template, say VTL, we can use methods similar to XPath.

## Hands-On
[JSONPath Expression Tester](https://jsonpath.curiousconcept.com/) can be used as a playground for all tests and checks. We can add a JSON in text area and write `JSONPath` expressions to check / validate the output.
